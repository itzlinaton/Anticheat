/**
 * ReachB — ping-and-interpolation-aware reach check.
 *
 * Where {@link ReachA} compares the attacker's eye against the target's
 * position right now on the server, ReachB compares it against where
 * the target actually appeared on the attacker's screen when they
 * clicked. Reconstructing that rendered position requires undoing two delays:
 *
 *
 *   Network latency. The target's position reaches the attacker's
 *       client roughly {@code ping/2} ms after the server knew it. We rewind the
 *       target's recorded position history by that many ticks.
 *   Client interpolation. The Notchian client never snaps other
 *       entities to a freshly received position; it lerps toward it over ~3
 *       ticks (~150ms). So the rendered entity trails the latest received
 *       position by anywhere from 0 to 3 ticks at any instant.
 *
 *
 * Because neither delay is known exactly (ping jitters; we cannot observe
 * where along the interpolation arc the client happened to be), ReachB does not
 * pick a single historical position. It picks a window of historical
 * ticks spanning the plausible range, computes reach against every position in
 * it, and keeps the minimum distance — the single most attacker-friendly
 * interpretation. Only if even that closest candidate is out of range does it
 * accrue violation.
 *
 * Position history
 * The per-tick server position of every player is recorded into the shared
 * {@link TargetTracker} by a 1-tick scheduler task below. History is keyed by
 * entity id and is identical regardless of who is attacking (server-authoritative
 * position); only the rewind amount is per-attacker.
